# 1. record the rosbag
ros2 bag record /pf/pose/odom /drive /ego_racecar/odom

# 2. run listener (just click play)

# 3. run rosbag
ros2 bag play rosbag.db3

# 4. run Visualization.py

IF listener has already been run, it saves a pickle file, so we just have to run Visualization.oy without recording or playing any rosbags
