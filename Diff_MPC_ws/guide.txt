HOW TO RUN:
- go to sim_ws and see INSTRUCTIONS.txt, u should be able to open novnc and see a car in a mpc_launch
- run particle filter first: ros2 launch particle_filter localize_launch.py
- run diff_mpc: ros2 launch mpc diff_mpc.launch

IF CAR STARTS GOING IN A WILD DIRECTION:
- make sure that the first trajectory index points to a point relatively close to origin

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For adding a new launch file consider:
launch files has to end with _launch.py
consider changing setup.py
colcon build

For changing environment, go to setup.cfg
- learning_mpc_env for diff_mpc_launch
- Johannes_MPC_env for mpc_launch and stanley_launch

for installing range_libc in particle filter do:
sudo pip3 install cython transforms3d
git clone https://github.com/f1tenth/range_libc.git
cd range_libc
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
cd ~/range_libc/pywrapper
sudo -E WITH_CUDA=OFF /path/to/miniconda3/envs/myenv/bin/python setup.py install
